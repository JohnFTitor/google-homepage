First set-up of google Homepage README.md.
 
The project I'm about to build is, as the name stands, a non-functional google homepage, to set the basics in HTML and CSS.

23/06/2021: I created tha base structure of the page, using the resources provied by the odin project. I set the navbar and search form. The footer was declared but yet created. As for the CSS, I like to use grid to set the sticky navbar, so I created one for the body element and one for the main content (Which contains the form and footer). I followed this tutorial for that: https://css-tricks.com/how-to-use-css-grid-for-sticky-headers-and-footers/. I also defined the positioning of the anchors in the navbar, but I have to modify them as I didn't include them in a list.
